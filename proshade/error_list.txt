GENERAL:
========

CODE:		Message:																												Comment:
E000001		No task has been specified. Please see the usage options available with the -h or --help arguments.						The settings object needs to have the Task variable set for any ProSHADE run to start.
E000005		The instance of ProSHADE_data which is trying to read in structure XXX is not empty.									Tried to read in structure into an object which already has had a structure read in (could be the same structure, does not matter).
E000006		The structure XXX is of unknown type or does not exist.																	Could not determine the type (PDB or MAP) of the input file when attempting to read it.
E000007		Failed to allocate memory.																								Generic error when malloc fails against nullptr.
E000014		No task has been specified for task specific constructor.																ProSHADE_settings class constructor", "This ProSHADE_settings class constructor is intended to set the internal variables to default value given a particular taks. By supplying this task as NA, this beats the purpose of the constructor. Please use the non-argumental constructor if task is not yet known.
E000056		Failed to open JSON output file.																						Failed to open json file to which the rotation and translation would be written into. Most likely cause is lack of rights to write in the current folder.

============
MAP READING:
============

CODE:		Message:																												Comment:
EM00008		Failed to determine the axis order of the input map file. Please report this case.										Tested for all axis orders and yet none of them applied.
EM00009		Cannot read from the map file. The map file mode is not supported.														The map mode must be 0 or 2, otherwise cannot read the map. This error states the map mode is neither supported value.
EM00015		Requested resolution not set for map re-sampling.																		There is no resolution value set, but map re-sampling to this unset resolution value is required. This error occurs when a task with no resolution requirement is requested on a map data and the map resolution change is set to 'on'. Either supply a resolution value, or do not re-sample the map.
EM00046		The map axes are not perpendicular. Only P1 cells are supported for now.												ProSHADE currently only supports map cells with perpendicular (90 degrees angled) axes. Your map seems to have differently angled axes and so cannot be processed by this ProSHADE version. This feature is coming in future update!
NO LONGER IN USE !!!	EM00065		The supplied map mask has different dimensions than the density map.													Most likely the mask is not the correct mask for this map, as it has different dimensions as the density map. Please review that the supplied map and mask form a pair.

============
PDB READING:
============

CODE:		Message:																												Comment:
EP00010		While attempting to open file XXX for reading, MMDB library failed to open the file. This 								Are you sure the file is not corrupted and that the path is right?
			could be caused by not being formatted properly or by memory not being sufficient	
EP00047		Cannot write co-ordinate file if the input file did not contain co-ordinates.											You have called the WritePDB function on structure which was created by reading in a map. This is not allowed as ProSHADE cannot create co-ordinates from map file.									
EP00048		Failed to open the PDB file XXX for output.																				ProSHADE has failed to open the PDB output file. This is likely caused by either not having the write privileges to the required output path, or by making a mistake in the path.					
EP00050		Found no model in co-ordinate file.																						Found 0 models in the input file <<FILE>>. This suggests that the input co-ordinate file is corrupted or mis-formatted.
EP00051		Found unknown element in input file.																					Gemmi library does not recognise some of the elements in the co-ordinate file. Please check the file for not being corrupted and containing standard elements.
EP00052		Missing form factor for element <<EL>>																					Gemmi library does not have a form factor value for this reported element. Please report this to the Gemmi library authors or to the author of ProSHADE.

RE-BOXING:
==========

CODE:		Message:																												Comment:
EB00002		There is no input structure for map manipulation.																		In MapManipulation task, the check for at least a single input file has failed.
NO LONGER IN USE !!!	EB00003		There are too many input structures for re-boxing.																		In MapManipulation task, the check for no more that one input file has failed.
EB00011		No resolution given for PDB file re-boxing. This cannot be done - please supply a resolution value.						No resolution value when MapManipulation from a PDB file.
EB00016		No output file name.																									There is no output file name set in the settings object. Please supply the file name to where the re-boxed map should be saved using the setOutputFilename() function.

==========
DISTANCES:
==========

CODE:		Message:																												Comment:
ED00012		There are not enough structures for distance computation.																There needs to be at least two structures between which distances are computed. The ProSHADE_settings object contains less than two structures and therefore cannot proceed. Please supply at least two structures by repeatedly using the addStructure() function.
ED00013		Resolution value not set.																								x
ED00017		Attempted computing energy levels descriptors when it was not required.													Attempted to pre-compute the RRP matrices, when the user has specifically stated that these should not be computed. Unless you manipulated the code, this error should never occur; if you see this, I made a large blunder. Please let me know!
ED00018		Attempted computing trace sigma descriptors when it was not required.													Attempted to pre-compute the E matrices, when the user has specifically stated that these should not be computed. Unless you manipulated the code, this error should never occur; if you see this, I made a large blunder. Please let me know!
ED00023		Attempted computing rotation function descriptors when it was not required.												Attempted to compute the SO(3) transform and the rotation function descriptor when the user did not request this. Unless you manipulated the code, this error should never occur; if you see this, I made a large blunder. Please let me know!

SYMMETRY:
=========

CODE:		Message:																												Comment:
ES00028		There are not enough structures for symmetry detection.
ES00032		Requested symmetry supplied, but not recognised																			The allowed values for requested symmetry are "", "C", "D", "T", "O" or "I". Any other value will result in this error.
ES00053     Symmetry axis detection tolerance set to negative value.          														The symmetry axis detection tolerance was manually set to negative value. This makes no sense, please supply value >= 0.0.
ES00057		Requested group elements for group which does not exist.																The requested point group index is outside of the bounds of the detected point groups vector. This is likely caused by wrong iteration over the point groups by the user.
ES00058		Unknown symmetry type: <X>																								Function getAllGroupElements was called with symmetry type value outside of the allowed values C, D, T, O, I or empty for using all supplied axes.
ES00059		Mismatch between supplied number of axes and symmetry type.																The supplied number of axes for group element detection ( >n< ) does not match the group type ( >X< ).
ES00060		Computed point group elements do not form a group.																		The supplied cyclic groups list does not form a group and therefore such group's elements cannot be obtained. Please check the cyclic groups list supplied to the getAllGroupElements() function.
ES00061		Failed to find enough neighbours for rotation function conversion.														The rotation function does not have enough points to be mapped onto the symmetry detection sphere format. This should not really happen, but increasing the resolution could help if this happend.
ES00062		Rotation function was not converted into angle-axis space.																It seems that the convertRotationFunction() function was not yet called. Therefore, there are no data to detect the symmetry from; please call the convertRotationFunction() function before the detectSymmetryFromAngleAxisSpace() function.
ES00064		Requested bicubic interpolation outside of pre-computed square.															The supplied x or y value is outside of the range of the bi-cubic interpolator's pre-computed square. Please make sure the start values were correctly supplied when the constructor was called or create a new interpolator for this case.
ES00070		Attempted to optimise less than two axes for dihedral group.															he function for optimisation of dihedral angle of D group was called on group with less than two axes. This seems like a programming bug and should not happen - contact author if you ever see this.

============
MAP OVERLAY:
============

CODE:		Message:																												Comment:
EO00033		There are not enough structures for map overlay computation.															ProSHADE expects exactly two structures for map overlay mode and this requirement was not met - thus the complaint.
EO00034		Cannot zero-pad in negative direction.																					The requested padded size of a structure is smaller than the current size. If the user sees this error, there is likely a considerable bug. Please report this error.

============
INTEGRATION:
============

EI00019		The integration order is too low.																						The Gauss-Legendre integration order is less than 2. This seems very low; if you have a very small structure or very low resolution, please manually increase the integration order. Othherwise, please report this as a bug.
EI00020		The Taylor series cap is too low.																						The Taylor series expansion limit is less than 2. This seems very low; if you have a very small structure or very low resolution, please manually increase the integration order. Otherwise, please report this as a bug.

=======
LAPACK:
=======

EL00021		The LAPACK complex SVD algorithm did not converge!																		LAPACK algorithm for computing the singular value decomposition of complex matrices did not converge and therefore it was not possible to combined SH coefficients from multiple shells. Changing the resolution may help, contact me if this error persists.
EL00022		The LAPACK complex SVD algorithm did not converge!																		LAPACK algorithm for computing the singular value decomposition of complex matrices did not converge and therefore it was not possible to optimise the peak positions in the (self-)rotation function. Changing the resolution may help, contact me if this error persists.

================
WIGNER MATRICES:
================ 

EW00024		Attempted allocating Wigner D matrices before allocating E matrices memory.												The E matrices and Wigner matrices both require to know the bandwidth of the comparison (which may differ from the object bandwidth). This is set when allocating E matrices and therefore if it is 0 now, E matrices were not  yet allocated.

=======
PYTHON:
=======

EP00044		Structure class input map has wrong dimensions.																			The supplied map array size has different dimensions to the required map dimensions.
EP00045		Structure class input dimensions not in line with map to/from indices.													The supplied map information does not add up. The dimensions are not in line with the indexing start/stop position distances and therefore proper map indexing cannot be done. Please check the input values.

CODE:		Message:																												Comment:
WP00055		Found multiple models in co-ordinate file while single is used.															This warning occurs when ProSHADE is run with the default PDB file single model usage, but the input PDB file has multiple models. If you want to use multiple models, please supply ProSHADE with the '-x' option.

WM00049		Requested both Fourier-space and real-space map re-sampling. Defaulting to only Fourier space re-samplling.				This warning results when both -a and -j options are given. If you are not using both, then consider that the Fourier-space re-sampling is default for some tasks.
WM00068		Requested box centre to be co-ordinate position outside of co-ordinates range. Please re-view the requested box 		The requested map box centre position (given in co-ordinate space) is outside of the map range.

WB00027		Attempted making map boundaries same between dimensions, but the original sizes do not allow this. 						As described in the message, when you have boundaries 1 3 5 and you say you want all boundaries with 3 to be the same size (as per the setBoundsThreshold() function),
			Therefore, map dimensions will not have the same size. This could be mitigated by adding more space 					ProSHADE will attempt to make the boundaries 5 5 5. However, if the original map was only 4 4 5, then this would not be possible and in this situation, you would see

WB00040		The deep copy pointer is not set to NULL. Cannot proceed and returning unmodified pointer.								When the deep copy function is called, it assumes that the argument pointer is set to NULL. If it is not, it cannot know whether it points to some other allocated memory or not and thus cannot proceed. Create a new pointer and 
																																	set it to NULL and then supply this new pointer to the deep  copy function to avoid this  warning.
WB00041		Requested bounds for structure index which does not exist. Returning empty vector.										The requested structure index for which the boundaries are to be returned by functions getOriginalBounds(), getReBoxedBounds() or getReBoxedMap() is higher than the number of structure supplied to ProSHADE.

WS00031		Failed to detect some of the polyhedral symmetries, while detecting the correct dihedral angles. 						This warning could mean that the structure is somehow similar to a polyhedral symmetry, but it does not contain it, or that ProSHADE failed. To test the present of this symmetry,
																																	decreasing the resolution could be a good approach. However, I, O and T symmetries do look alike when missing symmetry axis detection is done and therefore if one of these symmetries
																																	is detected, but the previous attempt gives this warning, it is likely the reported symmetry is right and the warning should be ignored.
WS00039		Requested symmetry index does not exist. Returning empty vector.														When requesting detected symmetry axes one by one, the code has requested symmetry axis index outside of the range. Please check the code if you wrote  it, it let me know if this is something I have done.

Solution is to change the computation resolution slightly so that the numerical issue no longer applies.

CODE:		Message:																												Comment:
NO LONGER IN USE !!!	WO00035		The progressive sphere mapping is not yet fully implemented for the map rotation. It has been turned off. 				The progressive sphere mapping was not yet implemented for map re-construction from the progressively mapped spheres. Therefore, it must be turned off for the Overlay task with phases part of the run.
WO00042		Requested rotation/translation values for Overlay functionality without having successfully computed it. Please 		This warning happens when either the getEulerAngles() or the getTranslation() functions are called, but the results are not available. Most likely another task was selected and these were not computed.

WO00066		Map centring was requested, but makes no sense for overlay mode. Turning it off.										Since overlay mode centers maps using Patterson and then finds to optimal overlay of the inputs, it makes no sense to center the maps before this.
